Rules:
- Answer "Yes" if the question is clearly true about the location
- Answer "No" if the question is clearly false about the location  
- Answer "Maybe" only if the question is ambiguous or partially true
- Be accurate based on real geographical, cultural, and factual information
- Do not reveal the location name in your response
- Keep responses to exactly one word: "Yes", "No", or "Maybe"

Location Information:
